# Healthcare-service
This is a simple React application that allows users to manage a list of healthcare services. Users can add, update, and delete services. Each service includes a name, description, and price. The app uses React hooks (useState) for state management and is styled using Tailwind CSS for a clean, responsive design.

## Features

- **Service List**: View all healthcare services with their details (name, description, price).
- **Add Service**: A form to add new services to the list.
- **Edit Service**: Update an existing serviceâ€™s name, description, and price.
- **Delete Service**: Remove a service from the list.
- **Form Validation**: Ensures all fields are filled before adding a service.
- **Responsive Design**: Styled using Tailwind CSS for a modern, clean interface.
